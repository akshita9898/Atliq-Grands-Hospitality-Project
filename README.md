# Atliq-Grands-Hospitality-Project
Atliq Grands, a prominent hotel chain across Hyderabad, Bangalore, Delhi, and Mumbai, is facing challenges with declining revenue and market share. To reverse this trend, the business manager is seeking a Data Analyst to drive data-oriented management decisions.
In my project, I used Jupyter Notebook to process data from 5 different files, enabling a deep dive into the company's performance. Hereâ€™s how I tackled the challenge:
ðŸ“Š Data Analysis with Pandas:
Loaded data using pd.read_csv() from multiple sources
Cleaned and transformed data with methods like dropna(), fillna(), and apply()
Identified unique values with unique() and grouped data using groupby()
Merged and joined datasets using merge() and concat()
ðŸ“ˆ Data Visualization with Seaborn:
Created simple visualizations to highlight key trends and patterns using seaborn.heatmap(), seaborn.boxplot(), and seaborn.barplot()
ðŸ§  Insights for Strategy:
Used lambda functions for custom transformations and derived key insights to help drive business decisions
This project highlights the power of data-driven strategies to help Atliq Grands regain its competitive edge and accelerate growth in the hospitality industry.
Methods & Functions Highlighted:
pd.read_csv(): Used to load data from CSV files.
dropna(), fillna(): Used for handling missing values in datasets.
unique(): To find unique values in a column.
groupby(): For grouping data and aggregating values.
merge() and concat(): For combining multiple data sources.
